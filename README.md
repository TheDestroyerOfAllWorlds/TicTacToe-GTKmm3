# TicTacToe Remake (GTKmm3)
A TicTacToe remake made using C++ and GTKmm3.

While GTK is well known as a Linux graphical toolkit, this particular application only works on Windows, because I use Windows.

Fortunately, downloading a GTK application on Windows is just as straightforward as it would be if the app was released for Linux.

# How to download and play:

```
1. Download the zip file located in releases and extract it

2. Inside the TicTacToe folder, go to: mingw64 --> bin --> game_tictactoe.exe

That's pretty much it
```
